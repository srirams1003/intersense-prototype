## Sample Script To Use For Development

```
Stage 1: Decision to Open Netflix
- The first thing we’re going to talk about today is why you use Netflix. On an average day, why do you open up Netflix? 
- Tell us about the times of day you watch?
- Who is with you when you are watching Netflix?
- What other things are you doing when you are watching?
- Tell us about your mood when you are watching?

Stage 2: Content Discovery
- The next thing we want to know about is how you find what you watch. Specifically, once you have Netflix open, give us your first thoughts: how do you choose what to watch?
- In general, can you describe your strategies you use to find recommended content? What do you usually end up watching?
- How do you get recommendations? How often are these from friends or family? Or other sources for instance: Blogs, articles, websites, forums, social media? How often are they from Netflix?
-  Which of these recommendations are most valuable to you? 
- What does it feel like to find something that has not been recommended to you contrast with what does it feel like to watch something that has been recommended to you?
- How do you feel about recommendation engines supporting you in discovering new content?

Stage 3: Content Consumption
- We want to also know more about how you’re watching Netflix. At the end of a show/movie, Netflix starts playing the next episode of that show/related shows/next movie automatically. Can you describe a time when this has happened to you?
- How long do you tend to watch Netflix content at a time?
- If you are watching a TV show, do you tend to watch one or more than one episode at a time? 
- What are your thoughts on how Netflix releases episodes should they be weekly or whole seasons at once for new shows
- If you finish a movie, do you tend to watch another one? What do you do when you see the recommendation starting to be played automatically?   

Stage 4: Post-Session Emotion
- Next, we want to know how Netflix makes you feel. How do you tend to feel after a session of watching Netflix? 
- Is there anything you would like to change about how you watch Netflix? 
- What do you appreciate about your relationship with Netflix or how you watch or watching behavior?

Stage 5: Additional Comments and Conclusion
- Finally, we want to learn more about what you like and dislike about Netflix. If you were to design a platform similar to Netflix, what would you keep? 
- Are there any Netflix features we did not cover that are particularly useful or helpful to you?
- Are there any Netflix features we did not cover that are particularly harmful or unhelpful to you?
-  How does your experience on Netflix compare with other streaming media platforms you use? 
-  Is there anything else regarding Netflix that you want to talk about?
